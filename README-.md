### The Project

This project is the design of an NFT-preview component card. 
The end results is to write a code solution of the design given and achieve usability.  

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Resources
* The project design you are working on to build are in the design folder in JPG static Format.Visualize
the design and creatively redesign it using your own conceptual understanding of the end results.

* In the images folder you will find all the assets you need to create the design already optimized for use.

* Feel free to use other resources you are inclined to in building this project.

## My process
1. Created the HTML backbone to give structure to my conntent and assigned classes.

2. Linked up my Css folder to the HTML to allow styling of the content.

3. General styling in my Css folder and declaring of variables to utilise with my classes.

4. Initialize a repository to publish my code to a web adress.

### Built with

-  HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
1. One major learnings added up my sleeve is the utilisation of the root element to create css variables.
this  has helped me in writing cleaner css code and most importantly creating efficacy. 

2. Media queries are important and it has come to my realisation that the ones I utilise in my projects are not optimal
because  on screen rotation the design falls apart, so it a major learning to continue exploring.

3. Writing Code that just get the work done is not the equivalent of Writing one that is concise and works optimally,
it is important to make sure it is fast,clean and works integratively with the overall design.

4. Being the first project that has created a necessity to utilise Git ,Learning Basic Git usage has stretched 
my skillset getting me into the actual workflow of a developer.

5. Learning how to plan ahead and how to go about each project professionally is a concept I will explore
further,realisation of the importance of this process cannot be overlooked.


### Continued development
1. Media Queries; This is a concept I have to continue building upon,in modern Css media queries are inevitable when 
building so comes the necessity of understanding and properly utilising them in project.    

2. Advanced Css concept that have come to my scope while working through this project will be a  thing
to look forward to while invirogating my skillset.

3.Git and version Control; well this is totally new to me and I have the taken the first leap
towards learning it.

4. Building on a consistent and predictable pattern is crucial otherwise run the risk of things falling apart
or making it hard to mantain.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://devdocs.io/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
